# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Error: Vague 'metro' Bundler Failure

This repository demonstrates a strange bug encountered while building an Expo project using the Expo CLI. The issue manifests as a vague error message from the 'metro' bundler, providing insufficient information for effective debugging.  The error is only reproducible on a specific development machine, highlighting a potential environment-specific factor.

## Problem

The core problem is an unhelpful error message from the 'metro' bundler during the build process. The error message lacks details about the source of the problem, making it extremely difficult to track down the root cause. Standard troubleshooting steps (cache clearing, dependency reinstallation, etc.) did not resolve the issue.

## Solution

The solution, as demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, involved identifying and resolving a subtle issue within the project's codebase where a seemingly innocuous syntax error caused the problem. This shows the difficulty in diagnosing vague bundler errors.

## Steps to Reproduce (on affected machine only)

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`.  The error should manifest.
4. To verify the solution, replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and rebuild.
