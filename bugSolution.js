The original `bug.js` contained a subtle syntax error (e.g., a missing semicolon or a wrongly placed bracket). This error, though seemingly minor, triggered an obscure error in the 'metro' bundler due to the complexity of JSX or other features.  The corrected version, `bugSolution.js`, fixes this syntax error.  While this specific error is illustrative, the lesson applies broadly; in case of vague 'metro' errors, focus on meticulously checking your code for even small syntax issues and inconsistencies.
