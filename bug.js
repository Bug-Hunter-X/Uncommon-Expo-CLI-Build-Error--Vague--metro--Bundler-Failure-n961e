While building an Expo project, I encountered a peculiar error related to the 'metro' bundler. The error message was vague, mentioning something about a 'transform' failing or an unexpected token, without clearly specifying the problematic file or code section.  This made debugging very difficult, as the stack trace wasn't helpful in pinpointing the root cause.  I tried standard troubleshooting steps such as cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking for conflicting package versions, but none of these addressed the core issue. The problem only occurred on a specific development machine; building on a different machine worked without issues.
